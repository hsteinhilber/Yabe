## Welcome to Yabe ##

Yabe is a yet-another-blog-engine. Yes, I know, not very creative, but it works.
The whole point of Yabe is just to familiarize myself with Ruby-on-Rails and to
write an actual application that will get used. Where will it get used? Why my
[own blog](http://yabe.heroku.com "Random Code Patterns") of course!

So can you use this engine for your own blog? Absolutely. I am releasing all of
this code under the [MIT license](http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php).
As such, you can use the code as you see fit. Just keep in mind that a lot of the
actual content for the site (specifically images, titles, etc.) will be specific
to my own blog and will need to be changed. 

If you have any questions or comments about the engine, feel free to drop me a
line by [email](mailto:harry.steinhilber@gmail.com), 
[twitter](http://www.twitter.com/hsteinhilber) or on [github](https://github.com/hsteinhilber).
